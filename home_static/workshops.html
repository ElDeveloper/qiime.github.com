	<h3>Hosting an official QIIME workshop</h3>
	The official workshops will be lead by the QIIME Masters (QM). A QM is developer or expert user that is in charge of the <a hred="http://forum.qiime.org">QIIME forum</a> for 2 weeks, around 2 times per year. The forum is a virtual area where users can ask any kind of QIIME related questions and have their questions solved. This commitment requires to read and reply to every single incoming email, currently a little less that 1000 emails per month, including replies, which increments their already expert knowledge. Basically, they are not only experts on how to use QIIME, their algorithms and pipelines but they also know how to troubleshoot both software and methodological questions. The full list of QIIME Masters and their rounds (how many times they have being in charge of the forum) are:

    <br/><br/>
	For these workshops we normally require the participation of at least 2 QMs for up to 25 participants and then 1 more additional QM for every (up to) 25 participants, the cost per day of each day/instructor is $500USD, plus their expenses. The daily fee could be avoided in certain occasions and in case by case situations; enquire about this.
	<br/><br/>
	Antonio Gonzalez (antgonza at gmail dot com) and Greg Caporaso (gregcaporaso at gmail dot com) are currently organizing the workshops so if you are interested in organizing an official workshop or in becoming a QM. For organizers also add:    
	<ul>
	    <li>Is your workshop biological, ecological, software development, mix or other oriented?</li>
	    <li>What is the main purpose of the workshop (understand algorithms, pipelines, analyze their own data, software development, etc)?</li>
	    <li>How many participants are you expecting?</li>
	    <li>Do the participants have their own datasets? If so, what sequencing platform are they using?</li>
	    <li>What target regions are they using? What about primers? Do you want to include shotgun sequencing analyses?</li>
	    <li>What kind of computer resources do you have?</li>
	</ul>
